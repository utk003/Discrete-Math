# Discrete-Math
## About
This is my repository for things related to the discrete math class I took in 12th grade. I will upload all of the work I do in mathematica relating to the various discussions we have.

The textbook used for this class is [Excursions in Modern Mathematics by Peter Tannenbaum](https://books.google.com/books/about/Excursions_in_Modern_Mathematics.html?id=jYX1vQAACAAJ).

## How to Use
Each chapter's work will be uploaded into its own folder, which will contain a mathematica notebook, a markdown file, and any additional files necessary to run the notebook.

The mathematica notebook will be a direct upload of my own work.

The markdown file will be a stylized version of the notebook file so you can examine the code in a nicely formatted manner. The markdown file will be split into sections and code environments in a way that most accurately resembles those divisions in the notebook.

To use, either download the notebook files or reconstruct them piece by piece from the markdown file.
